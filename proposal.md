**The Big Idea:** 
Our idea is a journaling and mood tracking app. The app will remind users to journal at a set time every day, and ask users to rate their mood once they’ve completed their entry. Depending on their mood the app will give them a resource related to improving mental health or tell a joke or something to help keep their mood up. They will be able to track their mood later on through the app as well. 

**Learning Goals:** 

*Blake Learning Goals:*
* Learn how to create a time and date reminder
* Learn how to create an interface for a user to interact with other than visual studio 
* Learn how to display content in a visually pleasing way.
* Learn how to use databases with python
* Learn how to combine data science and programming

*Allyson Learning Goals:*
* Learn how to publish a program for others to interact with!
* Learn to combine knowledge of other programming languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript) to create a cohesive app
* How to program collaboratively 
 
**Implementation Plan:**
1. Figure out how to make a user interface that users can interact with normally.
1. Create a pseudo code framework for the different features.
1. Find/create a database of information to be provided when the user inputs their mood.
1. Start hard coding the idea.
1. Use time library to convert current time and desired time to journal to create reminder features.
1. Do user testing to find bugs.
 
**Project schedule:** 

*Week 1:* Learn how to code/implement features that we do not already know from class. 

*Week 2:* Continue learning and create mockups to work off of when we build the app and flush out ideas for what features it will have.

*Week 3:* Create a pseudo code framework for the hard coding

*Week 4:* Continue work from week 3. Find library of resources for mood boosting/mental health 

*Week 5:* (Journal and mood input parts) coding. Test progress.

*Week 6:* (Mood tracking and mood boosting parts) coding. Test progress.

*Week 7:* Connect the backend to the front end and implement. 

*Week 8:* User testing!

**Collaboration plan:** 
We plan to pair program most if not all of the project. We’ve worked together in the past and work well together so this is the best option and the best way for us to learn. If this ends up being an issue because of our schedules we will reevaluate later. We’re breaking the project into parts during week 5 and 6 because these seem to be reasonable chunks that will work together within the app to test at one time before we build the rest. This follows the agile methodology where you design, build, and test pieces as you work to ensure the project goes well and that we have time to fix issues while we build as opposed to all at the end. 
 
**Risks:** 
* We do not know how to create a user interface that can be easily interacted with.
* We may not be able to find a database with the content we need to provide the user with in response to their mood.
* We may not have enough time to complete the scope of this project.
  
**Additional Course Content:** 
The session on 10/12 (Text Analysis) could be helpful to us in analyzing a user’s entries for patterns or topics that they talk about a lot. “It’s been a long time since you wrote about X” type of reminders could be implemented as well.
